## What is functional programming?

a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

## Pure functions
It returns the same result if given the same arguments

It does not cause any observable side effects

## Pure functions benefits
1- Immutability
Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

2- Referential transparency

pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

Second part of read 09 : Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability
It a way to rewrite Some of the codes that took to the extreme and became very quick at the cost of being totally unmaintainable.

It's important to get your code right the first time because in many businesses there isn't much value in refactoring. Or at least, it's hard to convince stakeholders that eventually uncared for codebases will grind productivity to a halt.
